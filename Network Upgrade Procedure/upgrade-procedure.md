## Description

Document captures high level procedure and steps taken by EW to securely and reliably conduct EWC Zurich Hard fork. If you are looking for node upgrade scripts/manuals, please refer to other documents stored on root level of this repository.


## High Level Hard Fork (HF) Procedure

1. Determine suitable version of the clients for OpenEthereum (OE) / Nethermind
2. Determine upgrade procedure.
3. Conduct extensive local tests â€“ shadowfork tests conducted over Volta shadowfork ([reference](https://nethermind.notion.site/AuRA-Rewards-Contract-Shadowfork-1e5360fc38d0806ba6b6fb8c7531421c)).
4. Determine disaster recovery procedure.
5. Conduct Volta (EWC Testnet) hard fork (HF) following upgrade procedure.
6. Conduct EWC HF following upgrade procedure.

## Atomic Upgrade Procedure

### Shadowfork

1. Creation of new version of system contract.
2. Setting up Volta Shadowfork with both new versions of Nethermind and OE.
3. Execution of Volta Shadowfork HF with new system contract assuming happy path (all validators comply).
4. Definition of tests for post-HF validation.
5. Executing tests against Volta Shadowfork.
6. Execution of Volta Shadowfork HF with new system contract assuming unhappy path (not all validators comply).
7. Formulation of disaster recovery plan.

### Volta

1. Adjustment of tests for post-Shadowfork chain HF validation (if applicable).
2. Initial communication with validators about upcoming HF actions and the need for their node rectification.
3. New chainspec release ([Volta.json](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ewf-chainspec/blob/master/Volta.json)).
4. Creation of dedicated upgrade manual with both automated and manual upgrade procedures ([repository](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ewf-zurich-upgrade)).
5. Testing of new chainspec and new versions in the EW Volta environment.
6. Determining transition block number (for Volta, at least 1 week in the future).
7. Releasing communication of Volta upgrade to validators.
8. Creating backups of archive/fast node DBs for both Nethermind and OE in case of disaster recovery needs.
9. Temporary removal of non-operational (validators not actively validating) and non-traceable (validators for which it is impossible to determine whether they have performed the upgrade) validator nodes from active validator set right before the fork block.
10. Secure monitoring of the chain around the fork block time.
11. Execution of predefined tests against Volta.
12. Re-addition of fixed validator nodes back to validator set once ensured they are syncing properly with the network (might require node resync)

### EWC

1. Adjustment of tests for post-Volta chain HF validation (if applicable).
2. Initial communication with validators about upcoming HF actions.
3. New chainspec release ([EnergyWebChain.json](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ewf-chainspec/blob/master/EnergyWebChain.json)).
4. Creation of dedicated upgrade manual with both automated and manual upgrade procedures ([repository](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ewf-zurich-upgrade)).
5. Testing of new chainspec and new versions in the EW EWC environment.
6. Determining transition block number (for EWC, at least 1 week in the future).
7. Releasing communication of EWC upgrade to validators.
8. Creating backups of archive/fast node DBs for both Nethermind and OE in case of disaster recovery needs.
9. Temporary removal of non-operational (validators not actively validating) and non-traceable (validators for which it is impossible to determine whether they have performed the upgrade) validator nodes from active validator set right before the fork block.
10. Secure monitoring of the chain around the fork block time.
11. Execution of predefined tests against EWC.
12. Re-addition of fixed validator nodes back to validator set once ensured they are syncing properly with the network (might require node resync)
